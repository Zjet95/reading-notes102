# Javascript Control Flow

1. Control Flow is the order your client executes statements.
2. Control Flow will always run from the first line until the last line unless a **structure** changes that control flow.

## **Types Of Control Structures**

- Loops
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Events

## Functions

- A block of code that performs a particular task
- Defined by the **Function key word** followed by ()
- Functions follow the exact same rules as variables.
- The code that you would like to be executed is placed inside the **{} Curly Brackets**
- Arguments are the values recieved by your functions output
- When a return statement is reached the function will stop executing and return its entire value.
- Functions are made to be reused in your code
- You can use a function as a variable value.

## Operators

### There are so many different types of operators! Ex
