# Class 4 Notes

## Wireframe and Design

> A wireframe is a simplistic representation of a website or products layout and design, Wireframes are incredibly useful at the beginning of any design process this coupled with design thinking allows you to come parallel with what exactly it is your client is looking for in thier product, it allows you to map out the functionality and have a visual representation to show your clients before the actual engineering of the website begins and allows you to communicate easy in regards to strucutre, space allocation and schematics. **Always wireframe before you build!!**

## What is HTML?

> HTML is also known as **Hyper-text markup language**. Every webpage you see utilizes HTML to structure the webpage similar to a newspaper. HTML docs include headers, paragraphs and images just as a newspaper would but these are added using what is called HTML elements and tags. However HTML does not make your page look pretty, its just the bare bones layout before you begin to add styling.

### Example of HTML Skeleton AKA HTML Boilerplate

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <meta charset="utf-8">
 <title>HTML5 boilerplate – all you really need…</title>
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
 <!--[if IE]>
		<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
	<![endif]-->
</head>

<body id="home">

</body>
</html>`

## Semantics

> In software development semantics are used to work around explaining a piece of code and define meaning to your code, they provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation and makes your HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of webpages.
