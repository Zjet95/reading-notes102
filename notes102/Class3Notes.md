# Class 3 Notes

During Class 3 we were able to cover multiple methods of version control, Version control in simple terms allows simple tracking to software code and also makes it a lot easier to manage changes made to the software depending on what form of version control you utilze the can make it easier in a collaborative enviornment as well.

## **1. Version Control**

> Version control, also known as source control, is the process of  tracking and managing changes to files over time. VCS — version control systems — are software tools designed to help teams work together. You can use version control for versioning code, binary files, and digital assets, Version control includes version control software, version control systems, or version control tools. It is a component of software configuration management, sometimes referred to as VCS programming.

## **2. Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**

> In a centralized version control system (CVCS), a server acts as the main repository which stores every version of code. Using centralized source control, every user commits directly to the main branch, so this type of version control often works well for small teams, because team members have the ability to communicate quickly so that no two developers want to work on the same piece of code simultaneously. Strong communication and collaboration are important to ensure a centralized workflow is successful.

## **3. Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**

> Distrubed Version contorl is an alternate form of version control in whcih the complete codebase and its full history is mirrored on every other developers computer, Compared to centralized version control this enables automatic management, branching and merging and also speeds up most operations (except push & pull)

## **4. What is Git?**

> Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is a Distributed Version Control System.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Additonal GIT commands
2. More in depth instruction on CLI
