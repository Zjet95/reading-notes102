## Thoughts for collegues considering Code Fellows in the future / Brief Overview of Markdown
Code fellows has been absolutley amazing throughtout the first 8hr session, We have learned that utilizing Markdown withing **GITHUB** is extremly useful. What is Markdown you ask? Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to utilize quick of use *Authoring, Customization & is overall a lightweight enviorment* that doesnt take long to grasp as Markdown is easy to write and allows you to focus on the imporant things. The first day of class we have learned the basic syntax commands for Markdown in which I have listed below, these can be used to format your markddown page, Signs such has # will create your heading or H1 and as you keep adding am additional pound symbol ## your text will be a heading size smaller, this countinues all the way until H6 in which you can add 6 pound symbols to represent H6. I have added a Markdown reference list below.

    Indenting by 4 spaces will turn an entire paragraph into a code-block.

Result:

    .my-link {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    
    Typing an `@` symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.
