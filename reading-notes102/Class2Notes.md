## Class Day 2 Notes - The Coder's Computer

### Text Editors
A text editor can have many benefits to a developers workflow by adding ease of use ease of functionality and being able to edit the code in real time, Text editors usually come pre installed on your client and are fantastic and known for thier quick editing features but are not idea when conducting web elements. You also arent able to add things such as extnesions to make development easier within the text editior. It is primarily used for light editing. ***Quck links for getting started with Each Text Editor have been added below*** ‚¨áÔ∏è:

Examples Of Most Popular Text Editors:
* [Notepad++](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/getting-started/)
* [Text Mate](https://app.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started_with_Textmate/2)
* [Coda](https://coda.io/learn)
* [VIM](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim)

### Code Editors (IDE's)
A Code Editor Aka Intergrated development enviornment is used as the primary tool to build your websites with, it is a collection of additonal tools (Extensions) that assist in making the process of writing code easier, compared to Text editors IDE's also allow you to write code in different languages and utilize different features such as; Syntax highlighting, brace matching & autocompletion. ***Quck links for getting started with Each Code Editor have been added below, along with most popular editors in ranked order*** ‚¨áÔ∏è:

Examples Of Most Popular IDE's:

ü•á:[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/getting-started/)

ü•à:[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html)    

ü•â:[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui)

### The Terminal or CLI (Command Line Interface)
The command line interface allows you to communicate first and foremost with your device when giving commands ***Ex. "CD" when input in the CLI will signal action to your PC to 'Change Directory'*** The command interface also allows you to download additonal tools to comminicate with additonal resources such as GIT & GITHub , and allow the ability to push commands and commit changes to your GITHUB respository.


### CLI (Command Line Interface) Shortcuts reference Ex.:

* NPM - Installs Software via CLI
* CD **(pathname)** - Changes your directories 
* mkdir - Creates new directory (folder)
* clear - Clears the CLI window
* exit - Closes the CLI window

### Key takeaways:

So much valuable information was given in the first day of 102. Most notable Key takeaways from this session were, VS Studio Code is the primary choice of most developers it is also the leader in the IDE market. I also took away that committing changes to your GITHUB through the CLI is much faster once comfortable with syntax required. Also when uitlizing VS Code it is best practice to use added extensions to make things such as populating the HTML boilerplate along with other elements far easier, as it gives suggestions once you type the first character of the element you are attempting to use.
